Process Notes for MongoDB study
================================
    What is MongoDB?  MongoDB is a schema-less, NoSQL document database that allow syou to store your "documents" as
    json objects in the database.

Installation
=============
    o   Installing MongoDB is a little tricky in that you need to edit path variables and use the command window to run
        mongoDB on your local machine.  I've broken down the process of installation into the following steps:

        STEP 1: Download MongoDB using the community installer (DO NOT install Compass during installation because there
                are a few annoying issues that popped up).
        STEP 2: Find the navigation folder on your local machine.
            o   Fo example, "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin"
        STEP 3: Under "advanced system settings > enviroment variables", edit the path variable add the previous path.
        STEP 4: Install MongoDB compass


For the initial run of "mongod"
================================
    o   For the initial run of mongoDB, you would run "mongod":
    
            mongod

    o   However, when you first do this you might encounter an issue that says:

            exception in initandlisten: NonExitentPath: Data directory C:\data\db not found, terminating

    o   All this means is that the default folder that you would store your data in is not there yet, so you need to create it.
    o   To create your default folder, in Gitbash (NOTE: not command prompt), write:

            md c:\data\db
