## How do you install MongoDB?
Installing MongoDB is a little tricky in that you need to do a few things like editing path variables, using command prompt,
and adding a default storage file for your Mongo databases on your local machine.  Follow the steps below to get started with
MongoDB and take special note at some of the issues you might encounter and how to resolve them.


**Step 1:** Download MongoDB from https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community
> *note: make sure you download the community*


**Step 2:** Once the download is complete, install on your local machine
> *note: DO NOT INSTALL MONGODB COMPASS at this time.  A few issues made it difficult to install... install compass AFTER installation.* 


**Step 3:** Navigate to the installation folder, find "mongod" and copy the directory
> *note: Your installation file directory might be different, but it should look like this: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin*
> *factual note: "mongod" is "mongo daemon" which is the mongoDB server*


**Step 4:** In your search bar, look for "advanced system settings", select "enviroment variables", edit the PATH variable by adding the previous path.
> *note: make sure you put the entire path (i.e. "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin" ) in so that it works correctly*

**Step 5:** Install MongoDB Compass to use the database GUI (graphical user interface).
> *note: make sure you install the community verison*
